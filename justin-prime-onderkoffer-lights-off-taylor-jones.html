We’ve had “Love Me Better”, “<a href=#>Good Sex</a>“, his collaboration with Alawn on “<a href=#>Friends</a>” remix, and now we have this trap song he also features on. “Lights Off” sees Justin Prime and Onderkoffer come together with Taylor Jones providing the vocals for the track.</p><p>Dutch producer Justin Prime,&nbsp;whose real name is Justin Putuhena, has made quite the name for himself over the past few years. In 2012&nbsp; he went viral in a collaboration with Showtek; the song “Cannonball” charted well in Belgium, France, and The Netherlands. Two years later, it was re-released with vocals being provided by Matthew Koma, titled “Cannonball (Earthquake)” where it managed to chart in the UK at number 29. This track follows up “Light It Up” which was released in June.</p><p>As for Onderkoffer, he’s pretty new on the scene, having dropped his debut EP on Sidney Samson’s label Artificial Recordings in 2015. Since then he has been building up his career and he has gained many followers. This collaboration follows up his previously released track “Never Let Me Go” which was released in February 2017.</p><p>This is definitely a brilliant collaboration by Justin Prime, Onderkoffer, and Taylor Jones. It pushes all three into the Trap music genre, expanding all of their fans, and proving that they all deserve to have lengthy careers in music.</p><h3>Listen To Justin Prime & Onderkoffer’s “Lights Off” Featuring Taylor Jones Here:</h3><p>The track really showcases Taylor Jones’ brilliant vocals. He’s totally suited for this genre of music and we hope more DJs and producers will collaborate with him in the future. The song is full of deep synths with the drops going off every single time. Justin Prime and Onderkoffer make the perfect team-up, creating an unforgettable track.</p><p>“Lights Off” is available to download and stream now on Trap City Records under exclusive licence to Spinnin’ Records. This is one track we are certainly treasuring.</p><h4>What do you make of Justin Prime & Onderkoffer’s “Lights Off” featuring Taylor Jones?
