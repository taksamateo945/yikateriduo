Oscar Robertson summed it best with the quote on the question is he the greatest of all time, "The books don't lie". That's good answer, considering the fact that this guy holds 60 of the 72 NBA records!</p><p>Want some records? How about 100 points in a single games, 55 rebounds in a single game, only player to score 4,000 points in a season, scored 50 ppg through an entire season, and grabbed 27 boards, too.</p><p>He was arguably the most notable rebounding machine to play on a NBA hardwood,period.During his 15 years of pro basketball,he won the rebound titles 11 times in that period while winning 7 scoring titles as well</p><p>His height didn't make him great,it was the fantastic physical abilities combined with his skills. He was more then dunks.He had the fade away, finger role, and the hook shot.He posted the most insane and by far untouchable numbers ever</p><p>He was also phenomenal defender as well,who would likely been No.2 (or No.1) had blocks been as a official stat.His steals total would be high as well.He is one of the most all-around players ever,for who many believe he recorded quadruple double before it became official.</p><p>Overall,Wilt could be a strong choice for the honor of best basketball player ever and if you select him,it isn't a bad call.</p><p>Career Resume</p><p>-2x NBA Champion</p><p>-2x Finals MVP</p><p>-Rookie Of The Year</p><p>-All Star Game MVP</p><p>-9x All NBA Selections (7x All-First)</p><p>-13x All-Star</p><p>-2x All-First Defensive Teams (the honor came late in his career)</p><p>-Elected to the Hall Of Fame</p><p>-One of the 50 greatest players ever in the NBA History</p><p>-NBA 35th Anniversary Team</p><p>Career Facts</p><p>-NBA All Time rebound leader (in both total and per game)</p><p>-Holds 60 out of the 72 records in the NBA history (some of them will be mentioned)</p><p>-The first player ever to earn the MVP and Rookie Of The Year awards in his 1st year</p><p>-Has the highest field goal percent of all time recorded in a season (72.9)</p><p>-Scored 100 points (NBA record) in a single game</p><p>-Only player ever to record double-triple (20 points,22 rebounds,23 assists)</p><p>-His dominance changed couple of rules</p><p>-Holds record for most consecutive 30+ scoring games (65)</p><p>-Holds record for most consecutive 20+ scoring games (125)</p><p>-Only non guard ever to lead the NBA in assists</p><p>-Recorded high scoring average ever 50.4</p><p>-Led the NBA,7 seasons in a row in scoring</p><p>-Ranks at No.2 in career points per game</p><p>-Ranks at No.4 in total career points</p><p>-Ranks at No.1 in most minutes per game</p><p>-Rank at No.3 in career fields goal</p><p>-Ranks at No.5 in career player efficiency</p><p>-Ranks at No.2 in career offensive win share</p><p>-Ranks at No.4 in career defensive win share</p><p>-Ranks at No.3 in career win share per 48 minutes</p><p>-Ranks at No.2 in playoff rebounds per game</p><p>-Ranks at No.2 in playoff total rebounds</p><p>-Ranks at No.18 in playoff player efficiency</p><p>-Ranks at No.2 in playoff defensive win share</p><p>-Ranks at No.9 in playoff offensive win share</p><p>Career Stats</p><p>Points:31,419 (30.1)------------------------------3,607 (22.5)</p><p>Rebounds:23,924 (22.9)------------------------------3,913 (24.5)</p><p>Assists:4,643 (4.4)-------------------------------<span>673 (4.2)</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobGxoaW1%2BbrPImqWtq12ks27Ax55koJmdmsGpsYygqZ6ZpJrAtXnBop5mpZWjeqq6jK2fnmWel65utMisq6iqqQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
