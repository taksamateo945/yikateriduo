All five Kardashian-Jenner sisters, <strong>Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Kendall</strong>, and <strong>Kylie</strong>, gave a tech talk at the Apple Store in NYC’s Soho neighborhood on Monday, Sept. 14, where they shared advice about running successful social media accounts and opened up about each of their respective passion projects.</p><p>“We wanted to change our digital platform and make it more than just a blog that we had before,” Kim, 34, said. “I just felt like there was no other platform that could do it all unless we do it ourselves.”</p><p>The pregnant-again reality star, who did the most talking at the developer chat, shared that she was up the previous night until “3:30 in the morning torturing the Whalerock team to make sure everything was perfect.”</p><p>Each app will focus on the corresponding sister’s expertise: Kim’s will feature fashion, beauty tutorials, and selfies; Kourtney’s will hone in on motherhood; Khloe’s app will follow her fitness progression; Kendall’s program will feature her global adventures as a model; and Kylie’s app will spotlight makeup, her new home, and her dog, Normie Jenner. “Yes, we are sisters,” Kim told the packed crowd. “But our passions are very much individual.”</p><p>“I’m obsessed with being a mom,” Kourtney, 36, told the crowd. “All my friends come to me with mom questions.”</p><p>The apps are free to download, but there is a paywall that will cost users a monthly access fee of $2.99. “We want to hear from fans,” Khloe, 31, noted. “But we want to start changing the way of social media and have it be from all positives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Both she and Kim doled out advice to fans about social media engagement. “Be consistent and authentic,” Kanye West’s wife cautioned, while her younger sibling issued a warning about the downfalls of social media use.</p><p>“Whatever you post is going to last for a long time,” Khloe said of the Internet. “So make sure you are going to stand by everything you’re posting, because your brand is a reflection of yourself.”</p><p>As of Tuesday, the top Kardashian-Jenner app in the App store belonged to Kylie. Not only did she trump her sisters, but the youngest’s app also landed the No. 1 spot among all free apps.</p><p>“#1 I can’t believe it. I love you guys,” the 18-year-old wrote. “Can’t wait to post more tomorrow.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKaqpSWwKm1wKdko52eo7KzedKiqq2doqh6ra3Up5qhZZGlvbR51qGgnKBdpLumecisZK2noGJ%2FcX2Uamxy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
