I love my man,” Fletcher expressed to <strong>Lore’l</strong> from “The Morning Hustle Show,” according to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a> on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pjimage-7-600x338.jpg><p>The entrepreneur and social media guru also addressed comments about purchasing 28.8 acres of land for the “Wockesha” rapper’s 30th birthday on Sept. 22. Many viewed Fletcher’s purchase as an act of love, while “The Real” co-host <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Garcelle Beauvais</a></strong> felt Fletcher was “acting married” by buying such an excessive gift for her boyfriend of nearly two years.</p><p>“It’s expensive,” Fletcher adds about purchasing acres of land in Bagg’s hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. “It’s the biggest purchase I’ve ever made.”</p><p>When asked how she felt specifically about Beauvais’ comments, the 26-year-old said, “I feel like everybody needs to focus on what they doing, who they doing it with, and what makes them happy.”</p><p>She added, “So I just feel like….mind ya’ damn business.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot_2021-09-29-KYLESISTER-therealkylesister-•-Instagram-photos-and-videos-600x304.png><p>During a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">viral clip </a>of The Real” last week, Beauvais said Fletcher was “acting married” for buying acres of land for a man who has yet to put a ring on it. “That’s a huge gift to someone … that you’re not even married to. I feel like if a man gave me acres, I would feel obligated to stay with him if it didn’t work because that is such a good gift.”</p><p>Aside from remarks from Beauvais’ and “The Real” co-hosts <strong>Adrienne Bailon-Houghton</strong>, <strong>Loni Love</strong> and <strong>Jennie Mai-Jenkins</strong>, Fletcher has also been defending her 28.8 acre-purchase of love against fans on social media.</p><p>On Sept. 28, Fletcher wrote, “Y’all don’t know the half of what he does for me mentally or financially. I’ve never felt so safe, loved, spoiled and happy with a person. He loves me and my son so much. I’m sorry that you haven’t experienced a love like this. Focus on getting your own land and your husband.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’all don’t know the half of what he does for me mentally or financially.
