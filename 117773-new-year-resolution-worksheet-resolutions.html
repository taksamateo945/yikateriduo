A worksheet constantly reminds you of the resolutions and helps you connect with the things you want to achieve.</p><h3>How do you write a New Year's resolution?</h3><p class=align-left>Do not fret if you are unsure where to start with setting goals and resolutions for 2024.

Keep it short and realistic</strong></h4><p class=align-left>It is better to have realistic goals you know you can accomplish than to have ambiguous goals you might never reach. Realistic goals are better at motivating you to keep pushing.</p><h4><strong>5. Get out of your comfort zone and have fun!</strong></h4><p class=align-left>What are good goals for the new year?
