Obviously, I have familiarity, I was already late to spring so I didn't have to pack my bags and fly to Florida and all that and then move my family across the country. Dodgers being here in Arizona was convenient," he said.</p><p>In addition to the convenience of staying with Los Angeles, Hernández was presented with the chance for more playing time than he would have received in New York.</p><p>"The main reason was they were able to guarantee me to start at least against left-handed pitchers to start the year, and from there on, anything can happen," he said. "The Yankees have a really good lineup as well, just like the Dodgers, but they have a lot of right-handed hitters, and their lefties are not platoon guys."</p><p>Hernández played 54 games for the Dodgers in 2023 after being traded from the Boston Red Sox and hit .262 with five home runs and 30 RBI.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWZ%2BeIGMpKCknV2dsrO6wKebnrJdqcKzusSdZJ2np6N6uq3NpJyeq12pvG6%2FyKClZqaVrHqlu8OgnKurXZi8r8DRmpqtZZmjeq64wWadq52VYq6osc2csA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
