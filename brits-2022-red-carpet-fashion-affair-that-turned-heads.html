It was great to see so many well-deserved wins, and these accolades are impressive, but what makes an awards ceremony even more exciting? Yes, you are right- the alluring fashion looks adorning the evening like a golden star.</p><p>The biggest names in music from around the world — including <a href=#>Adele</a>,<a href=#> KSI</a>, <a href=#>Ed Sheera</a>n, <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a>, <a href=#>Joy Crookes</a>, <a href=#>Anne-Marie,</a> and many more — arrived at O2 Arena London to attend BRITs 2022 ceremony.</p><p>The stylish attendees finally stepped out on the red carpet, bringing the glitz and glamour with their top-tier fashion looks for the night, leaving behind all the virtual celebrations, awkward TikTok dances, and Zoom dressing sessions from the past year. Since the BRITs are renowned for their glitzy gowns and dramatic looks, the stars have indeed donned the finest evening attires the fashion world has to offer.</p><p>This year was no exception, as BRITs 2022 promised to be dramatic, custom-tailored, a little vintage, and styled with slight ’90s flair. This award night certainly provided a glimpse into the 2022 fashion trends- whether it’s sequins, cut-outs, dramatic silhouettes, or black remains the color of elegance, all coupled with dramatic makeup and bold accessories to accentuate the looks.</p><p>We bring you the most elegant, sophisticated looks to the hottest and boldest styles from the red carpet and the Brit award ceremony.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=joy-crookes>Joy Crookes</h3><p>As Joy Crookes strode the BRITs 2022 red carpet, it was as if a golden goddess just descended from the skies, glistening and bursting with golden splendor and looking magnificent.
