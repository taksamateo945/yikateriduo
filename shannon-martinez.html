As a business owner in the restaurant industry, I’ve made a commitment to keep my employees jobs protected and my customers fed, safe and looked after, so you best believe I’ll be doing everything in my power to uphold that commitment. In order to this this though, we might have to shake things up a bit and possibly, without much notice or options. We have already started increasing the ready meals at the deli and will soon be taking phone orders for pickup. Keep an eye on the Deli’s Instagram page for daily updates on what’s available. We will also be limiting the sandwich selection temporarily in order to give us more time to focus on making meals for you all to stock up on for the upcoming weeks. We are also considering offering take away at Smith & Daughters, so stay tuned for more updates on that. Local businesses that provide incredible food and service are suffering while the big supermarkets are making more money than ever. Support local, and let’s all work to get through this total shit fight together. Stay safe, support local, eat vegan.
