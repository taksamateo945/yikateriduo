Rumor spread on Wednesday, June 3, that <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> was dead, but the monarch is still alive and well.</p><p>The talk began when BBC broadcast journalist <strong>Ahmen Khawaja</strong> <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth is being treated at King Edward 7th Hospital in London. Statement due shortly: @BBC World." That was followed up by another tweet reading, "'Queen Elizabeth has died': @BBCWorld."</p><p><a href=#>According to NBC News</a>, the tweets were brought to the attention of Buckingham Palace, which shot down the rumors. The palace did confirm that the royal, 89, saw a doctor this week, but only for a checkup, saying in a statement, "This was a routine pre-scheduled appointment. The queen has now left [the] hospital and carries on with her engagements."</p><p>Though her tweets have since been deleted, Khawaja offered up multiple different explanations for the false alarm, <a href=#>NBC News reports</a>. She allegedly first blamed someone who had picked up her phone while it was unattended, writing, "Silly prank, Apologies for upsetting anyone!" and later said simply, "False Alarm: Have deleted previous tweets!!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The BBC gave its own explanation in a statement to NBC, citing a news exercise that was gauging the staff's readiness for the event of Elizabeth II's death.</p><p>"During a technical rehearsal for an obituary, tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist," the statement reads. "The tweets were swiftly deleted and we apologize for any offense."</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Khawaja went on to retweet a message from NBC's Alexander Smith, <a href=#>which reads</a>, "Buckingham Palace tells me Queen/hospital report 100% untrue, no idea where it came from."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKiunZWjeqa4yLOYm52knXqvu9Nmm56ZlGKxpr%2FPoqueZZKXsG6%2BxKmmq6yVp8BussClqp5lpKyypsDSZpuerJGeubR5kWlobmtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
