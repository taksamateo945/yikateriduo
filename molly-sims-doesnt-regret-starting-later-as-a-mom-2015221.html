Everything I’ve wanted to do, I’ve done. I lived in Europe for six years, waitressed, worked at a book company and in a law office.”</p><p>Now pregnant with baby No. 2, the supermodel admitted the second time around isn’t any easier though. “When I was pregnant with Brooks, I started feeling ill at around 4 p.m. every day during the first trimester,” she explained. “But with this one, I felt hungover from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Despite feeling more nauseous this time around, the soon-to-be mom of two admitted that with this pregnancy, she “learned not to freak out over every single symptom” and “Moreover, I know to wear my Spanx tights when I go out!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, The Everyday Supermodel author revealed on her blog she was expecting a mini-me. “Things are feeling very rosy at the Sims-Stuber house right now!!” she wrote in her “Tickled Pink” blog update. “I announced the big news back in September, with the most AH-dorable little chalkboard signs that I found. Now I’m ready to share with you all that I’m having a GIRL!!”&nbsp;</p><p>“We couldn’t be more excited,” she continued. “I can’t wait to meet our baby girl and I just know that Brooks is going to be the very best big brother ever.
