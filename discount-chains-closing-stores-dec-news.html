For some people, this could soon be a little harder. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Off-price retailers</a> are the obvious go-to when you're trying to buy at a deep discount. Now, major companies like Family Dollar and Marshalls are closing some locations for good. Read on to learn about all the discount stores on their way out, starting Dec. 17.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Thrift Stores Including Goodwill Are Closing Locations, Starting Dec. 23</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/family-dollar-overcharging-shoppers-news.jpg><p>Family Dollar is reducing its retail footprint in December. The dollar store chain is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>closing a store</a> in Huntingburg, Indiana, in about a week, the Dubois County Free Press reported. According to the newspaper, the Huntingburg Family Dollar store will shutter permanently on Dec. 17.</p><p>And that's not the only one of the retailer's stores closing. Family Dollar is also <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>shuttering its store</a> in Little Chute, Wisconsin, this month, Kauna Community News reported. According to the news outlet, the last day of operation for this Family Dollar location will also be Dec. 17.</p><p><strong>Donny Anderson</strong>, the store's manager, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>confirmed the closure</a>&nbsp;in a post on the Kaukauna Community Group's Facebook page. "It is with a heavy heart that I announce that the Little Chute Family Dollar store is closing," Anderson wrote. "We would like to thank from the bottom of our hearts the community of Little Chute, and the surrounding areas for the many, many years of supporting our store."</p><p>Best Life reached out to Family Dollar for more information about the closures, but has not yet heard back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/marshalls-store-stop-sign.jpg><p>Another off-price retailer, Marshalls, is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>set to shutter</a> a store in Minneapolis, the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal reported on Dec. 8. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the closure in an emailed statement to Best Life and said the store is expected to close permanently on Jan. 14.</p><p>"We are always assessing and reviewing our real estate strategies, and our decision to close this store reflects that thinking," Marshalls said in its statement. "<span>We are grateful for the loyalty of our Minneapolis customers and invite them to visit our nearby stores to continue to find great values, including the Marshalls in Roseville and the T.J. Maxx in Saint Paul</span>."</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel=noopener>For more up-to-date information, sign up for ourdaily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/shutterstock_228210184.jpg><p>Big Lots is also joining the ranks of store closures for the new year. A favorite destination for deals, the retailer is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>closing a location</a> in Citrus Heights, California, the Sacramento Business Journal reported on Dec. 7. Big Lots spokesperson <strong>Josh Chaney</strong> confirmed to the newspaper that the Citrus Heights store will close sometime in January.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Best Life reached out to the company to see if an exact date has been announced, but has not yet heard back.</p><p>"We review our store portfolio on an ongoing basis and sometimes decide, for a variety of business reasons, to close or relocate," Chaney told the Sacramento Business Journal.</p><p>And that's not the only <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Big Lots closure</a> on the horizon.&nbsp;During a Dec. 1 earnings call, <strong>Jonathan Ramsden</strong>, the company's executive vice president, chief financial officer, and administrative officer, said that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the retailer actually</a> has "an accelerated number of closures" planned. The closures will help Big Lots increase revenue, according to Ramsden.</p><p>"The closures this year will end up being somewhat higher than the openings," he said. "Going forward, we would hope and expect to return to a normalized level of closures, but we'll certainly continue to look closely at underperforming stores."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/going-out-of-business-sign-furniture-stores-closing.jpg><p>While Family Dollar, Marshalls, and Big Lots are only closing select locations, one discount chain is planning to shutter all of its stores.</p><p>Weekends Only Furniture & Mattress is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>going out of business</a> completely, Furniture Today reported. According to the trade journal, the St. Louis-based discount retailer will permanently close all eight of its stores. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Weekends Only currently</a> has five locations in Missouri: Bridgeton, South County, St. Peters, West County, and Springfield. The company also operates one store in Fairview Heights, Illinois, and two Indiana stores in Castleton and Greenwood.</p><p>Weekends Only is closing because current CEO <strong>Tom Phillips</strong> is retiring. "We are so grateful for the many team members who worked with us and the customers we have been fortunate to serve," Phillips said, per Furniture Today. "There has been so much change in our industry over the past few years and given the storm of challenges retailers face, now is a right time to retire and celebrate the success and good fortune we've had in the business."</p><p>The retailer is working with Planned Furniture Promotions to handle its liquidation and going-out-of-business sales. Officials for the furniture promotion company told Furniture Today&nbsp;in November that an exact date has not been set for closures, but that sales are expected to begin in January.</p><p>Best Life reached out to Planned Furniture Promotions for more information, but has not yet heard back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnaGjmLy2utNmmqGZmaPAbq%2FLqKqippdiwLW70Z6qZpyVmHqvsdasZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
