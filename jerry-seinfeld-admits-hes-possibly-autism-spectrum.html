Either way, comic <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a> opened up to Brian Williams on the NBC Nightly News telling him that he believes he is on the Autism Spectrum. Those with children or friends or family who suffer from Autism might not want to hear this discussed so casually and without medical diagnosis, but it seems that the actor feels it could be something he lives with.</p><p>“I think, on a very drawn out scale, I think I’m on the spectrum,” he said about his recent education about Autism. Intrigued, Williams asked him to describe the markers Seinfeld believes he has.</p><p>“You know, never paying attention to the right things. Basic social engagement is really a struggle. I’m very literal. When people talk to me and they use expressions, sometimes I don’t know what they’re saying,” he goes onto say. He admits that he’s been doing some research in recent years and that he can see how it could apply to him in a very loose manner. He’s had no professional diagnosis, he’s simply stating he feels that he identifies with the spectrum and feels he could be on it in a manner.</p><p>We don’t know if he plans on speaking to a doctor about it, but we do know that he does not consider it a problem in his life. “I don’t see it as dysfunctional. I just think of it as an alternate mindset,” which is something that many people likely agree with. The spectrum is wide, and it is broad, and without professional opinions, it’s open to interpretation. However, the comic has made a great deal of fame and fortune and success for himself engaging in social engagement. However, the revelation was shocking.</p><p>Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGihnqqirnq0scinnZ6klGKupbnIrapmoJWoerG70qygm6SpYq62wMispGaroJqwtb7UpmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
