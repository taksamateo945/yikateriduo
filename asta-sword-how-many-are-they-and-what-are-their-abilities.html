These swords are greatly useful as the protagonist of the Black Clover manga and anime series in the magic-dominated Clover Kingdom has no magic.</strong></p><h2><strong>Asta Swords and Their Abilities</strong></h2><p>The first of these legendary weapons is the Demon-Slayer Sword, obtained through his five-leaf black clover grimoire. Categorized under the branch of Sword Magic, this unique weapon allows the user to conjure swords from thin air. The Demon-Slayer Sword’s most striking attribute lies in its ability to nullify and counter magic, making it an indispensable asset in battles against magical foes. By extending Anti Magic from the edges of the blade, Asta can enlarge the sword, while the flat side effectively deflects incoming spells. After extensive training in the Heart Realm, Asta gains the capability to remotely control the Anti Magic within the sword, enabling precise summoning and manipulation.</p><p>The second of Asta’s swords is the Demon-Dweller Sword, another anti-magic weapon, which he acquires during a fierce encounter with Mars in a dungeon. Similar to the Demon-Slayer Sword, the Demon-Dweller Sword can counter magic attacks. However, it possesses an additional advantage—it passively absorbs magic over time, accumulating power for a devastating ability known as Black Slashes. This Anti Magic-infused sword grants Asta the capacity to release powerful Anti Magic slashes from a distance and even harness the attributes of other magical elements by borrowing magic from nearby individuals. Only Asta, devoid of mana, possesses the exclusive ability to wield this potent weapon.</p><p>The third sword in Asta’s arsenal, the Demon-Destroyer Sword, reigns as the mightiest among his weapons. Its awe-inspiring ability, known as Causality Break, grants the sword the power to disrupt the causal relationship between spells and the natural world, effectively altering the flow of time and nullifying reincarnation magic. Furthermore, the Anti Magic tendrils of the Demon-Destroyer Sword excel at absorbing and removing spell side effects, providing Asta with a strategic advantage during intense confrontations.</p><p>In addition to these three extraordinary swords, the Black Clover manga introduces a fourth sword wielded by Asta, known as Yami’s Demon Slasher Katana. Temporarily lent to Asta by Captain Yami Sukehiro during a battle with Dante Zogratis, this katana becomes infused with Anti Magic when touched by Asta’s devilish arm, enabling him to deliver a potent blow to his opponent. However, the origins and future of this katana remain shrouded in mystery.</p><p>Asta’s mastery of these anti-magic swords, along with his innate demonic powers and unyielding determination, solidify his position as an exceptional and inspiring hero in the Black Clover universe. Despite lacking conventional magical abilities, Asta’s unwavering spirit and exceptional weapons elevate him to the forefront of the ongoing battle against evil forces threatening the Clover Kingdom.</p><h2><strong>How Many Swords Does Asta Have?</strong></h2><p>In the captivating world of the Black Clover anime, Asta possesses a total of three swords, each acquired at various stages of his heroic journey. These swords serve as symbols of his growth and development, not only in terms of combat prowess but also as a testament to his magical capabilities.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that in the Black Clover manga, a fourth sword comes into play—the enigmatic Yami’s Demon Slasher Katana. As Asta continues to hone his skills with the Demon Destroyer Sword, this katana’s origins and potential significance remain shrouded in mystery. It remains a possibility that its original owner may reclaim the sword in the future.</p><p>As Asta’s quest unfolds, these swords stand as tangible reminders of his indomitable spirit and unwavering determination to become a formidable force in the Clover Kingdom. With each blade representing a significant milestone in his journey, Asta’s evolution as a hero and his mastery of anti-magic become increasingly profound, making him an iconic figure in the Black Clover universe.</p><h2><strong>Asta Sword Names</strong></h2><p>In the enthralling world of Black Clover, Asta, the resolute protagonist, wields a formidable array of swords, each bearing a unique name and possessing exceptional abilities.

During the dungeon exploration arc, Asta, alongside Noelle Silva and Luck Voltia, embarks on a perilous adventure to test their abilities and grow stronger.</p><p>Amidst their challenging journey through the Dungeon, the trio encounters a formidable opponent named Mars, who wields crystal magic. The intense battle results in Asta’s trusty Demon-Slayer Sword breaking, leaving him weaponless and vulnerable. However, fate intervenes, leading Asta to the discovery of a new grimoire within the depths of the Dungeon. This newly acquired grimoire unveils the powerful Demon-Dweller Sword, bestowing upon Asta unique anti-magic abilities that greatly enhance his combat prowess.</p><p>This turning point in Asta’s quest becomes a powerful symbol of his unwavering determination to become an unstoppable force within the Clover Kingdom.

This pivotal moment showcases Asta’s growth and resilience as he defends his comrades against overwhelming odds. Although Mars’s healing abilities momentarily weaken Asta, his unwavering determination persists, leaving viewers eager to witness more of his heroic journey in the enthralling world of Black Clover.</p><h2><strong>What Episode Does Asta Get His Third Sword?</strong></h2><p>In the Black Clover anime, Asta acquires his third sword, the Demon-Destroyer Sword, in Episode 100, aptly titled “We Won’t Lose to You,” which corresponds to Chapter 157 of the manga.</p><p>During the intense battle in the central chamber of the Eye of the Midnight Sun’s dungeon, Asta, driven by his unwavering determination and aspiration to become the Wizard King, bravely faces the possessed elves Klaus and Hamon. Despite being outnumbered and facing formidable opponents, Asta showcases his growth as a Magic Knight by skillfully countering their attacks with his unique abilities.</p><p>As the battle unfolds, Yuno, who had been under the influence of an elf, regains control of his senses and joins Asta in their struggle against the elves. Together, they unleash the full extent of their power, successfully defeating their adversaries and restoring their comrades.</p><p>However, the formidable leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht, emerges as a formidable opponent, wielding the Demon-Destroyer Sword. Asta senses the immense power radiating from Licht and realizes that his black form is approaching its limit. Undeterred by the overwhelming odds, Asta resolves to push beyond his limits and continue the fight. Together with Yuno, they launch an unyielding assault on Licht. Amidst their fierce attack, the Demon-Destroyer Sword becomes dislodged, and Asta, with remarkable agility, catches it mid-air.</p><p>The confrontation reaches its climax as Licht unleashes a potent magical blast from the Demon-Dweller Sword. With unwavering determination and solidarity, Asta and Yuno defend themselves and their fellow Royal Knights, showcasing their unyielding spirit and camaraderie.</p><p>The acquisition of the Demon-Destroyer Sword marks a significant milestone in Asta’s journey, further solidifying his position as a formidable force within the Clover Kingdom. With this third sword, Asta gains access to the unique ability of Causality Break, or Fate Release. This spell enables the sword to absorb all surrounding magic, effectively erasing its effects by taking away their source. It is a manifestation of Asta’s indomitable spirit, a potent tool against the forces of darkness, and an embodiment of his unwavering determination in the captivating world of Black Clover.</p><h2><strong>How Much Does Asta Sword Weigh?</strong></h2><p>Asta’s swords possess distinct characteristics that contribute to their overall weight and combat capabilities. The primary weapon, the Demon Slayer Sword, measures approximately two and a half feet in length and weighs around forty-five pounds. This longsword, crafted by a skilled artisan in the city of Astas, features a substantial and sharp blade, a simple grip, and a sturdy yet lightweight construction. It is renowned for its durability and effective combat skills.</p><p>On the other hand, the Demon Dwelling Sword, Asta’s secondary anti-magic weapon, exhibits different traits. Discovered towards the end of his battle with Mars, this sword is thinner and more ornate compared to the Demon Slayer Sword. It measures around 8 feet in length and weighs approximately 2.5 pounds, making it significantly lighter than its counterpart.</p><p>The Demon Slayer Sword excels in dealing massive blunt damage with each swing, functioning effectively as both a weapon and a shield. However, its weight makes it slower, limiting its suitability for parrying and reflecting high-speed attacks. In contrast, the Demon Dwelling Sword’s lighter weight enables Asta to swing it much faster, making it ideal for defending against rapid assaults that might overpower the Demon Slayer Sword. Nevertheless, the trade-off is that its weaker blows render it somewhat less powerful than the primary sword.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BWwLWtjKyuqKqUYrWww4ymmKexXZa%2FpnnToZyyZZGjsW7Dx5qrZpmimnq1tMSiqWaZkp65qsDInqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
