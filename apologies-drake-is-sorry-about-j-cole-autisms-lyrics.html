Cole’s</a> apologies for his hurtful lyrics about autism on his “<i>Jodeci</i>” freestyle, <a href=#>Drake</a> has followed suit. The Toronto star has issued an apology as well and has officially vowed to remove the lyric from the song.</p><p>According to <i>MTV.com:</i></p><p>“J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in <i>Jodeci Freestyle</i>. ‘I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused,’ the Young Money MC wrote on his&nbsp;<a href=#>October’s Very Own blog</a>&nbsp;on Monday night.”</p><p>Now Drake vows to remove the controversial line from the song. “Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted,” he said. “This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.”</p><p>This is the right move for Drake, for sure. It continues to be a positive week for him, as he had a<a href=#> $16 million lawsuit against him thrown out </a>as well.</p><p>According to <i>spin.com</i>:</p><p>“It’s a classy move by Drizzy, and comes on the heels of some other good news for the Toronto rapper. Earlier yesterday, he learned a judge&nbsp;threw out a $16 million lawsuit&nbsp;against him and Chris Brown over their&nbsp;2012 nightclub brawl. Looks like everything’s coming up Drake.”</p><p>We know October’s Very Own is set for a big year, with his new album, “<i>Nothing Was The Same,”&nbsp;</i>set to be released this September. Drake, of course, already has singles out and has <a href=#>just released a myriad of new music</a> (which included this controversial “Jodeci” freestyle) a few weeks ago. Now he can put the drama behind him and get to the music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX50e49wZmtrX5a9sLjOoKCeq12Zv6K3xGagrGWjpL%2BzxYyamaitpGK3bq%2FOpZxmmaWptrS50majsqqZmMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
