She is presently dating a South African rapper, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>AKA</a>, who is famous for releasing several successful studio albums such as ‘Touch My Blood,’ ‘Be Careful What You Wish For,’ and ‘Levels.’</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The love birds began their romantic affair in late 2021.</strong></p><p>They, however, made it public in February 2022 after keeping it secret for many months. Since Nadia Nakai’s relationship with AKA became official, there have been mixed reactions from fans. This has made the cute couple to be making the news headlines constantly. Besides AKA, Nadia Nakia has dated several A-list music artists, including Vic Mensa.</p><h2><strong>The Truth About AKA and Nadia Nakai’s Relationship</strong></h2><p>Kiernan Forbes, known professionally as AKA, is known to have <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>dated</a> many top South African entertainers in the past years. In late 2021, the rumor mill had it that AKA and Nadia Nakai had caught the love bug and were secretly dating. The two ignored the rumor and never commented on it.</p><p>Later in early 2022, the couple went on a romantic vacation together. Though they never made the affair public knowledge at the time, their social media fans were able to deduce that they were posting individual pictures of a romantic getaway from the same location. Despite efforts by the couple to keep the relationship secret, they eventually let the cat out of the bag in March 2022.</p><p>They <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>confirmed</a> the much-speculated affair via Instagram post, which cleared every doubt and instantly made the relationship official. Subsequently, Supa Mega and Bragga started flooding their social media handles with pictures of them showing a public display of affection. As a result, they have emerged as the most talked about celebrity couple in Mzansi.</p><h3><strong>How AKA and Nadia Nakia’s Relationship Took Off</strong></h3><p>While still signed to Family Tree Records, owned by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cassper Nyovest</a>, who is considered to be AKA’s toughest <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>rival</a>, Nadia Nakai was featured on Kiernan’s Braai Show. The two have worked together on many occasions, including the 2016 single ‘Baddest’ (remix). Hence, they have a special respect for one another.</p><p>They started as friends and never imagined ending up together. On March 4th, 2022, they announced their relationship by posting a video of them sharing a smooch at Orthodox VIP Lounge in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Johannesburg</a>. AKA and Nadia shared the video with the same caption, “Mega 2 Mega.” Since the relationship materialized, the two seemed to be meant for each other.</p><p>They <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>share</a> loved-up posts on Instagram accompanied by an admirable lovey-dovey exchange of comments between them. In May 2022, the love birds were sighted at Konka, a well-known hip and happening spot in Soweto. It was a cozy outing, and the couple couldn’t wait to let the fans into their PDAs. Nadia shared a picture of herself having the best moment of her life, cozying up to her guy, AKA. She captioned the picture, “The One.”</p><p>She also shared a post where she was singing and dancing to Forbes’ songs as he performed on stage with D.A.L.E.S. Supa Mega, on the other hand, shared on Instagram a picture of Nadia leaning in for a kiss with a caption, “Ragga ragga ragga.” Apparently, their sizzling romance has become a trending topic in Mzansi as it has been met with many <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>controversies</a>.</p><h3><strong>Did AKA Assault Nadia While in Ghana?</strong></h3><p>On April 15th, 2022, a month after making their relationship official, Nadia and AKA went to Accra, Ghana, for different work engagements. Soon after, it was reported that there was trouble in the couple’s paradise. Daily Sun reported that the rappers were involved in a heated physical and verbal altercation.</p><p>The incident reportedly occurred in a club, and AKA was allegedly escorted out of the club. This led to Forbes and Nadia breaking up after a few months of dating. Shortly after the incident, Nadia Nakai and her boyfriend <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>unfollowed</a> each other on Instagram. When the news started circulating, AKA followed Nadia back, but it took the ‘Naked Nakai’ singer a little while to follow her boyfriend back on Instagram.</p><p>In the heat of the matter, the couple released two joint statements to clear the air about the rumored assault. Firstly, they cited their disappointment over how their exciting working trip to Ghana suddenly turned into a public smear campaign. They stated in the post that no verbal or physical abuse happened between them in Ghana.</p><p>The second statement was directed at Daily Sun. The couple asked the media channel to apologize for running a false story regarding their trip to Ghana, or they will face a lawsuit of R800,000 for defamation of character. Despite their efforts to convince the public that there was no drama between them, some Twitter users still assumed that there was indeed a physical altercation from the weekend trip.</p><p>This resulted from musician <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Moonchild Sanelly</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">choosing</a> not to comment on the issue even though she spent the weekend with Supa Mega and Bragga and had the same working commitments as Nakai.</p><h3><strong>Why AKA and Nadia Nakai’s Relationship Often Stirs the Social Media</strong></h3><p>Even though AKA and Nadia Nakai seem head over heels in love, their relationship has garnered heavy criticism from naysayers. In recent months, some of Nakai’s fans have judged her for choosing Supa Mega, known to have a temperament issue, after the video where he was seen forcefully trying to open the door where <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Anele Tembe</a>―his late finaceé was, went viral. He was also seen engaging in a heated verbal altercation with her.</p><p>AKA, on the other hand, is being slammed for rushing into a new relationship barely a year after he lost his former partner. Among the celebrities who have publicly aired their opinion about Nadia Nakai’s relationship with AKA is <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ntsiki Mazwai</a>. Reacting to the couple’s announcement of their newly found love, Ntsiki expressed her concern in a now-deleted tweet.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>stated</a> that she found it deeply disturbing that Kiernan Forbes moved on with his love life just months after the demise of his fiancée, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nelli</a>, who took her own life by falling from the 10th floor of the Pepperclub Hotel in Cape Town. She also highlighted her discomfort about some things that occurred during Nelli’s funeral. She cited that she still remembers Nelli Tembe and will not erase her.</p><p>Podcast and Chill host <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mac G</a> also weighed in on AKA and Nadia Nakai’s new relationship alert. He <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>said</a> on an episode of Podcast and Chill that he doesn’t believe that the love affair is real, that it seems more like a publicity stunt. And he is yet to see convincing chemistry between the two famed rappers.</p><p>Since Nadia Nakai’s new relationship came to light, there has been a growing number of divided opinions about the couple’s romantic escapade. While some are celebrating the blossoming new love, some others are expressing serious concern about the relationship.</p><h2><strong>Meet Nadia Nakai’s Boyfriend, AKA</strong></h2><p>Nicknamed Supa Mega, Nadia Nakai’s heartthrob was born Kiernan Forbes on January 28th, 1988.

While dating, the two made public appearances as a couple and seemed very much in love. As a result, Nadia Nakai’s relationship with Dotcom was hardly a secret.</p><p>The pair even worked together on Nakai’s second single, ‘Whatever.’ They melted the hearts of many fans with loved-up pictures and videos of each other they regularly shared on social media. Despite seeming like a never-ending affair, the cute couple parted ways in 2016. Nadia Nakai, however, stated that it was a mutual agreement between them.</p><p>In an interview in September 2016, the singer cum TV presenter <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that their breakup was out of love. She and Dotcom decided to split to allow each other to focus on their pursuits. She further cleared the air that they didn’t get separated due to external parties; rather, they felt they needed to give each other some space to grow.</p><p>Having supported each other for a long time, the former couple has remained good friends despite their relationship not working out. Interestingly, they hope to rekindle their romance someday.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Nadia Nakai’s Ex-boyfriend, Dotcom?</strong></h3><p>Dotcom, whose real name is Gcina Nkula, is a South African DJ, dancer, and hip-hop artist.

They, however, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>confirmed</a> the relationship in January 2018 after claiming to be just friends for some months. Rumors of the two being together started circulating when they were often spotted together at events.</p><p>According to the DJ, the relationship was not a publicity stunt. They fell for each other after working together on many occasions as they were both signed to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cassper </a>Nyovest’s Family Tree Records at the time. Bandile was never shy to express how Nadia made him feel. He even cited that the ‘Imma Boss’ crooner made him a better person as she is an amazing person to be with.</p><h3><strong>Bragga Won Gold from Her Breakup With Bandile</strong></h3><p>After Nadia Nakai’s relationship with Bandile Mbere collapsed, she poured her heart about their love story in one of her songs titled, ‘More Drugs’ feat Tshego. The relationship ended before she dropped her first studio album. Thus, the album was hugely inspired by the heartache she suffered from the breakup.</p><p>However, the pair never divulged the reason behind the end of their beautiful love story, which came as a shock to their fans. It was noticed from her ‘More Drugs’ lyrics that Bragga was devastated by the sudden separation. However, the bad situation turned into a big win after the single, released in January 2020, was certified gold by RISA.</p><p>The SA Style award winner couldn’t resist her amusement, and she took to social media to announce how her ironic breakup had won her gold. She shared an image of herself holding her gold win plaque. ‘More Drugs’ additionally won Nadia Nakai a South African Hip Hop Award for Best Video in 2020.</p><h3><strong>What Makes Major League’s Bandile Mbere Famous</strong></h3><p>Bandile and Banere Mbere are twin brothers who formed the music group Major League.
