He started a sporty kid playing rugby, tennis, golf, soccer, and cricket and even winning the Eastern Transvaal Junior Championship as a junior <a href=#>tennis player</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/386cd1963778dee7.jpg><p class=align-left>When he was 8 years old, he took an interest in golf. His father, a trucking executive at the Germiston Golf Course, taught the young golfer how to play, and soon after, he was much more skilled than his dad and older brother. By the time Ernie was 14, he was a scratch handicap. His skill was undeniable, and it was around this time that he decided to focus on golf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e17eca8740c02e12.jpg><p class=align-left>He was just 16 when he competed against <a href=#>professional golfers</a>, but his first major win came in 1984 when he won the Junior World Golf Championship. At 17, he was breaking world records being the youngest person ever to win the South African Amateur Championship.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p class=align-left>Ernie Els wife, Liezl, and the golfer tied the knot in 1998 and have been together ever since. Ernie Els children are Samantha and Ben.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/73b0d47be33d06ad.jpg><p class=align-left>After the birth of his son Ben, in 2002, the pro golfer had some issues that he had not disclosed to the public. Despite all the success he was having in the field, he was struggling to be a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">good father to Ben, his autistic son.</a></p><p class=align-left>His son was slow to develop, and soon a diagnosis that the boy was autistic changed their lives forever. In 2008, they decided to go public with their son's neurodevelopmental disorder. Soon after, Benâ€™s parents launched the <i>Els for Autism Foundation</i> to raise money and awareness for the study of autism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/67e70b1f2eb76650.jpg><p class=align-left>That same year, 2008, the couple was overwhelmed with their son's condition and decided to move to <a href=#>Jupiter, Florida</a>, from their home in London, to open the <i>Els Centre of Excellence</i>. The idea was to open a place where all children in the autism spectrum could thrive and be nurtured. It took 8 years to build and was opened in August 2015.</p>When I'm around my boy or talking to my boy, I change. I just go into his world. I'm kind of at peace because I'm listening to my boy being himself.<h2>Ernie Els career</h2><p class=align-left>Ernie has had a long and successful career.
