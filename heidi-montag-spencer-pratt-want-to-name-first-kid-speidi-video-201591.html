The catch? Montag refuses to use it for a daughter.</p><p>“If we named our child Speidi, it would be incredible,” Pratt joked when he and his wife stopped by <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>‘s New York City offices this week to chat about their stint on WE tv’s <a href=#>Marriage Boot Camp</a>. “It would be Speidi Pratt, legally.”</p><p>Sounds…unique? “If they really didn’t like their name when they grew up and were aware of the situation,” Pratt added, “they [could] pick whatever name they want.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The Hills alums also dished on their love of watching (and starring in, clearly) reality TV, with Montag telling <strong>Us</strong> that her Real Housewives tagline would be: “I may be plastic but I’m still fantastic!”&nbsp;</p><p>The joke, of course, is a play on her infamous penchant for plastic surgery. Back in 2010, she underwent 10 procedures in one day to enlarge her breasts, slim her thighs, and alter her face. (She later went back under the knife to reduce her size-F implants, which caused significant back problems.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If I could do one more thing plastic surgery-wise, I would definitely fix my brain,” the 28-year-old reality star quipped to <strong>Us</strong>. “I would upgrade my brain. I definitely need a chip in it, or an alteration, or, like [<strong><a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a></strong>‘s recent sci-fi character] Lucy, just tap me in 25 percent or something.”</p><p>Her husband of six years, 31, has a similar sense of humor about his own aptitude. Asked whether he had any special abilities people might not know about, he joked, “I have no hidden talents or visible talents.”&nbsp;</p><p>Watch the video above for much more from Speidi, including their most prized possessions, their favorite TV shows, and whether they ever watch reruns of The Hills.
