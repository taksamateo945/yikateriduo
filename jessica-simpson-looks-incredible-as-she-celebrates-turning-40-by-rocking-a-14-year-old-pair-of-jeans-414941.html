Simpson easily fit into her True Religion jeans after losing 100 pounds in six months last year after giving birth to her youngest child, and she shared a pic on Instagram.</p><p>Just hours before it was officially her 40th birthday (July 10), Simpson posted a makeup-free mirror selfie to show off the jeans and to commemorate her major life milestone.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCcYC-Tj6nh/</p><p>“I have kept these throwback True Religion jeans in my closet for 14 yrs (I’m not exaggerating!),” Simpson wrote in the caption of the pic. “I figured that since I’m in the final hours of my 30’s I’d give them another try, and hello 40, so nice to meet you.”</p><p>Fans loved the look, including former Mad Men star January Jones who wrote: “You look about 15 lady.” Another fan added: “you’re such an itty bitty thing ❤️ but also, weren’t true religions just the best?”</p><p>In addition to turning 40 this week, Simpson also celebrated her 6th wedding anniversary with her husband, <a href=#>Eric Johnson</a>. The couple celebrated six years of wedded bliss on Sunday, July 5, and in an Instagram post Simpson wrote that she married her “perfect soulmate.”</p><p>In the Open Book author’s sweet tribute to the former NFL player, Simpson wrote that their unity was “written in God’s sky of colliding stars. She added that they “manifest dreams, nurture desire, and hold space” together, and they “always have been and always will be.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CB6IdA3nER5/</p><p>Simpson and Johnson met in May 2010 and tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in 2014 at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California. They are the parents of three children: Maxwell Drew, 8, Ace Knute, 7, and Birdie Mae, 15 months.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Take My Breath Away singer has been gearing up for her 40th birthday over the past few weeks. In June, she celebrated the “final days” of her thirties with a bikini photo on the beach. The pic featured Simpson in a cowhide-print bikini and a black hat, and in the caption she wrote: “YEE-HAW to my final days in my 30’s.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamsC0tcKaZKyhnaXAsLqMpaaoo6Nitq%2Bv0Z6bopqcmnqiv4ysn55lk5q5pq7Rmqueq12pwrO6yKeeZmxgYq%2B6edGomqShnpx6onmQbWSynZGnerC4w2anmqGiYrynecmemKerXWl%2BdYWTamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
