If one searches for Michael Oher’s wife on Google, one of the search results yields the name, Tabitha Soren. And, while Soren is related to him in some ways, she is not his wife.</p><h2>So, who is Tabitha Soren?</h2><p>Soren is a fine art photographer from the United States, as well as a former NBC and ABC reporter. She is, in fact, the wife of Michael Lewis, an American financial journalist.</p><p>Lewis is also the author of The Blind Side, a 2006 book about Oher’s troubled childhood, adoption into the Tuohy family, and meteoric rise as a football player. The book was then adapted into the 2009 film of the same name.</p><h2>Oher’s Real Wife and Children’s Information</h2><p>Oher’s actual wife remains, to say the least, unnamed. There is very little public information about his wife and children.</p><p>Having said that, she manages a private Instagram account with the username @7tiff4tiff. Furthermore, according to multiple sources, Other’s wife’s name is Tiffany Michelle Roy.</p><p>On August 10, 2015, Sean Tuohy Jr., UCF Football’s Director of Football Operations, posted a picture on Instagram that revealed Oher’s wife’s face.</p><p>Oher was adopted by the Tuohy family, specifically Sean Tuohy and Leigh Anne Tuohy. As a result, the former NFL player and his wife Tiffany maintain a positive relationship with the Tuohy family.</p><p>In another case, Oher’s wife made headlines after Oher was involved in an infamous Uber incident. Oher allegedly assaulted an Uber driver while intoxicated in July 2017. He had asked the driver, Girma Berkessa, to follow the car in which his “wife” was seated.</p><p>Oher later attacked him after he told Oher that the car they were following was heading in the wrong direction. The former American football player reportedly believed the driver was attempting to defraud him and confronted him.</p><p>Oher did appear in court later that year, in October. Neither the accuser nor the defendant, however, made their statements public.</p><h2>Michael Oher: Property, mansion</h2><p>While Oher was extremely careful to keep his private affairs private, some information did leak from time to time. Oher’s opulent mansion is a prime example.</p><p>Oher paid a whopping $1.3 million for a grand mansion in Brentwood in 2014. The mansion did not appear to be something Oher, if he were a bachelor, would buy. On the other hand, the mansion could be one of his NFL money investments.</p><h2>Michael Oher: Achievements & Awards</h2><p>He was named ‘First Team Freshman All-American,’ ‘First Team All-Quad Freshman Chrome [AQFC] Tackle Letius,’ and ‘First Team SEC All-Freshman’ in 2005, and ‘Second Team All-SEC’ the following year.</p><p>In 2007, he was named to the ‘First Team All-SEC,’ and the following year, he was named to the ‘First Team All-American,’ as well as the ‘Shug Jordan’ award as the ‘Southeast Offensive Lineman of the Year,’ as well as the ‘Colonel Earl “Red” Blaik Leadership-Scholarship Award.’</p><p>In 2008, he was named an ‘Outland Trophy finalist,’ a ‘Conerly Trophy finalist,’ a ‘Lombardi Award semifinalist,’ and a ‘SEC Jacobs Blocking Trophy finalist.’</p><h2>Michael Oher: Personal History and Legacy</h2><p>Author Michael Lewis published a book titled ‘The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game’ in 2006, in which Oher was a subject. The section of the book ‘The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game’ centered on Oher was adapted into a film of the same name, which was released in 2009.</p><p>Oher published his autobiography, ‘I Beat The Odds: From Homelessness to The Blind Side and Beyond,’ in 2011. Don Yaeger, an American sports journalist, collaborated on this book.</p><h2>Michael Oher: Net worth</h2><p><strong>This dynamic athlete has a net worth of $15 million as of December 2023,</strong> according to Celebrity Networth.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWdnrCprcSlZKiglad6rq3Rq6CenF2pvG7AwJugraCRYsCwvsSnZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
