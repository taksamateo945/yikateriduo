By figuring out the solutions to the clues, you must place letters in the white squares to create words or phrases. The answer words and phrases are arranged in the grid from top to bottom and left to right ("across") in languages where writing is done from left to right ("down"). The words or sentences are divided using the shaded squares.</p><h2>What are the Types Of Crosswords?</h2><p>Isnâ€™t it exciting to know the different types of crosswords? American-style crossword grids frequently have 180- or 90-degree rotational symmetry, which means the grid may be rotated and yet maintain its original appearance. It is normally square and 15 by 15, though others can measure 17 by 17, 19 by 19, or even 21 by 21. Similar to British-style crossword puzzles in design, these crosswords are a little bit more difficult. The different shapes that thematic crosswords take truly make them stand out from more common square or rectangular crossword puzzles.</p><li><p>American-Style Grid</p></li><li><p>Cryptic</p></li><li><p>Thematic</p></li><li readability=-1><p>British Or South-African Style Grid</p></li><li><p>Barred Grid</p></li><li><p>Cipher</p></li><p>British crossword puzzles do not have the restriction that every letter must be used in both a Down and an Across word like American crossword puzzles do.
