I love it because it’s a lot more mature and is very musical.&nbsp; <strong>Matt Prime</strong> produced the song and I wrote it. It all came together, very quickly. In a matter of a couple of hours, really. I just felt so inspired as soon as I heard him playing instruments and I was just like yeah, this is it.”</p><p><strong>Listen to ‘Count The Ways’ below:</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Keen to build up the buzz surrounding the release of ‘Count The Ways’, Fleur will take to the stage at <strong>Union Chapel</strong> in London next month, where along with performing previous single releases ’Sax’, ‘More & More’, ‘Favourite Thing’, and ‘Size’, she will debut new material!</p><p>Tickets for the show on Thursday, March 16th 2023 are on-sale <a href=#>now</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on her career thus far, the former <strong><a href=#>X Factor</a></strong> contest says: “I’m really excited to be releasing new music.&nbsp;The last body of work I released was my album ‘Fearless’, which was my first independent album since leaving <strong>Syco</strong> in 2020. It was shortly after my dad passed away and just at the time that the pandemic came into our lives, and everyone went into lockdown, so I had to cancel my tour, I had to cancel all my promo, I had to cancel everything. It was such a shame that it was released at that time, and it was really difficult. Since then, and since losing my dad, I’m just finding my stride again and getting back into music.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I started writing this year and I just felt so inspired and everything just came back to me.&nbsp; It’s been a while since I’ve done my own live show and I absolutely love performing. After being on Strictly every weekend, the buzz of performing&nbsp; came back. I absolutely love it, and I can’t wait for people to hear this new music. It’s coming from a different place, it’s a lot more mature – it comes from a real place.”</p><p>“Music is my first love, and it always has been. Although I do presenting, fitness, and lots of other different things, music is my number one love and I always feel quite vulnerable sharing my music with everybody because it’s really a deep part of me.&nbsp; So I always feel a bit exposed when I share music with everybody, but I just feel like I’m in a place now where I’m ready for everyone to hear it.”</p><p><strong>‘Count The Ways’ is available to download / stream <a href=#>now</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Let us know your thoughts on Fleur East over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a> now!</strong></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ks62x1KtknpmjqXqwuoynnLBlo567qLjEZpqorZ6perW0xGaumrGjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
