He underwent a procedure in February to address the meniscus injury and was slated to be evaluated in four weeks.</p><p>The reigning NBA MVP was considered the favorite to repeat when he went down. He averaged 35.3 points, 11.3 rebounds and 5.7 points over his first 34 games, highlighted by a 22-game streak of scoring at least 30 points.</p><p>The Sixers have a 10-21 record with Embiid out of the lineup this season, and they have lost four of their past five games to dip to 36-29 on the year, which puts them seventh in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Philadelphia has essentially gone from a clearcut championship contender with Embiid in the lineup to a team that may have to go through the postseason play-in tournament without him.</p><p>Paul Reed has replaced Embiid in the starting lineup, and he is averaging 7.2 points and 5.8 rebounds per game this season.</p><p>The Sixers have no shot of being a serious contender and are in danger of falling out of the playoff race with Embiid on the mend. Tyrese Maxey has been an All-Star this season but isn't capable of single-handedly carrying the mantle with Embiid on the sidelines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG1%2FdoKMo6aepF2auqO1yJ1kq62dpL%2B0ec6pq6Klmai6boOVnqmsZaOprrN5wpqlZqqVqcKzuoybrK1lpaOwrbHAq2SwoJWj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
