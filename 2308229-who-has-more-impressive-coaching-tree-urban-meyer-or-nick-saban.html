Saban's tree blooms from his one year at Toledo (1990), five years at Michigan State (1995-99), five years at LSU (2000-04), two years with the Miami Dolphins (2005-06) and eight years at Alabama (2007-present).</p><img alt="8 Nov 1997: Head coach Nick Saban of the Michigan State Spartans looks on during a game against the Purdue Boilermakers at Ross Ade Stadium in Lafayette, Indiana.

We have to know whose tree impresses more.</p><p>To answer that question, we've ranked each protege based on two factors: (1) how much they have accomplished since working under Meyer/Saban, and (2) how influential Meyer/Saban was in their mentorship.</p><p>One FBS head coach, for example, falls on Meyer's coaching tree after serving one year as Utah's defensive line coach in 2004. His resume is more impressive than some of the students ranked above him, but he ranks lower because he spent so little time under Meyer.</p><p><span>After ranking each coach, we pitted the five best Meyer pupils against the five best Saban pupils for a head-to-head comparison. We also added some categories at the bottom to account for depth.</span></p><p>We'll score each matchup like a boxing round: 10-10 if the sides are even, 10-9 if there's a slight winner, 10-8 if there's a decisive winner, and 10-7 if there's a blowout winner. At the end, we'll add up those grades to see which Sugar Bowl head coach has the better tree.</p><p><span><strong>1.

He has the better winning percentage. He's had the better teams. He's won three conference titles and one national championship.</p><p>But as members of Meyer's and Saban's respective coaching trees, this matchup is closer than that first table makes it appear.</p><p>Mullen is a true Meyer product. He followed Urban from Bowling Green to Utah to Florida, then left to take an SEC head coaching job. There was no in-between period in which he was mentored by, say, the second-winningest coach in college football history (and first if you listen to the NCAA record book), Bobby Bowden.</p><p>Fisher is less a Saban protege and more a composite of Saban, <a href=#>Les Miles</a> and Bowden, all of whom he served as offensive coordinator for multiple seasons. There were five years between Saban and Fisher's breakup and Fisher's first head coaching gig. Mullen went straight from serving Meyer to running his own program.</p><p>That's enough to keep this one close.</p><p>Verdict: Saban 10, Meyer 9</p><p><span><strong>2.

He was the only member of the previous regime that Meyer kept around, and the pair accomplished great things before Strong went to Louisville in 2010.</p><p>Mark Dantonio, like Jimbo Fisher, coached under Saban for five years but didn't become a head coach as soon as he left. Instead, he plied his trade under Ohio State head coach Jim Tressel for three seasons, then went off to become the head coach of Cincinnati in 2004.</p><p>Comparing Strong with Dantonio is difficult, if only because the latter has a six-year head start. Strong has not accomplished what Dantonio has accomplished—lifting a program to its first Rose Bowl since 1987—but he is far ahead of the curve. His Louisville teams were better than Dantonio's Cincinnati teams, and his first Texas team finished the regular season 6-6.</p><p>Dantonio's first Michigan State team finished 7-6.</p><p>On merit, these two are a wash. But again, Meyer gets the slight edge for context. Strong was his defensive coordinator and left directly for his first head coaching job. Dantonio was Saban's defensive line coach and left for a three-year immersion program under Tressel.</p><p>Verdict: Meyer 10, Saban 9</p><p><span><strong>3.

His 2011 Owls went 9-4 and posted their highest&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Rating Score</a>&nbsp;since 1986, which helped Addazio land the Boston College job in 2013.</p><p>Addazio and McElwain have similar reputations as smart offensive coaches.

After the Utes went 12-0 and won the Fiesta Bowl in 2004, Meyer left for Florida and Whittingham succeeded him.</p><p>It's hard comparing Garrett's NFL career with Whittingham's college career, although it should be mentioned that both just enjoyed resurgent seasons. Garrett led the Dallas Cowboys to an NFC East title after three straight 8-8 years, and Whittingham led Utah to a 9-4 record after two straight 5-7 years.</p><p>(It should also be mentioned that Whittingham won the biggest game of his career over Saban in the 2009 Sugar Bowl, capping a 13-0 season with a 31-17 romp over previously unbeaten Alabama.)</p><p>Still, the cachet of Garrett leading a Super Bowl contender after starting his career under Saban gives him the slight edge in terms of impressiveness.

The only two who work together are Auburn co-offensive coordinator Dameyune Craig and co-defensive coordinator Charlie Harbison, but Craig and Harbison are from different eras of the Saban line.</p><p>Still, it's hard to pick one group of coordinators over the other. Bedford, Gonzales and Hevesy are great at what they do, and so are Michigan defensive coordinator Greg Mattison and Florida defensive coordinator (and current interim head coach) D.J. Durkin.</p><p>But Jeremy Pruitt won a national championship under Saban protege Jimbo Fisher last season, Todd Grantham coaches a heck of a Louisville defense, and James Coley turned true freshman Brad Kaaya into one of the breakout quarterbacks of the season at Miami.</p><p>This seems like another wash.</p><p>Verdict: Meyer 10, Saban 10</p><p><span><strong>8.
